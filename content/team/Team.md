I am a professor of political science at the Univerosty of Cologne. My primary research and teaching interests are social science methods with an emphasis on causal inference, qualitative and multimethod research, and research transparency and reproducibility. Substantively, I sometimes work on political parties and party politics. You can find most up-to-date information about my research on my [personal homepage](https://ingorohlfing.wordpress.com).

My name is Samrawit Berhane and I was born 09.07.2001 in Cologne. I am a student of the University of Cologne for social sciences (bachelor's degree) and I plan to do my master's degree in political science. The social and economic inequalities in our society are something that I always have been interested in and eager to learn more about. Existing inequalities must continuously be pointed out and talked about which is why I think this project makes a valuable contribution to this conversation.
