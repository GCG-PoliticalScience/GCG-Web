## [Ingo Rohlfing](https://twitter.com/ingorohlfing)
I am a professor of political science at the Univerosty of Cologne. My primary research and teaching interests are social science methods with an emphasis on causal inference, qualitative and multi-method research, and research transparency and reproducibility. Substantively, I sometimes work on political parties and party politics. You can find most up-to-date information about my research on my [personal homepage](https://ingorohlfing.wordpress.com).


## [Katie Nutley]()
My name is Katelyn Nutley. And I am the Gender Citation Gap’s doctoral researcher. I have an undergraduate degree in International Relations from the College of William & Mary and the University of St Andrews. I additionally hold a double Master’s in Comparative Politics and in International Administration and Global Governance from the University of Konstanz and the University of Gothenburg, respectively. I previously studied globalisation and identity politics at the University of Zürich. At present I am enrolled at the University of Cologne, where I am working on my dissertation concerning partisanship and police response.

## [Samrawit Berhane](https://cccp.uni-koeln.de/de/team/students)

My name is Samrawit Berhane and I was born 09.07.2001 in Cologne. I am a student of the University of Cologne for social sciences (bachelor's degree) and I plan to do my master's degree in political science. The social and economic inequalities in our society are something that I always have been interested in and eager to learn more about. Existing inequalities must continuously be pointed out and talked about which is why I think this project makes a valuable contribution to this conversation.
